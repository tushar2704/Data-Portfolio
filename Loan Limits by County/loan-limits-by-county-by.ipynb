Loan limits set a maximum dollar amount on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) are willing to buy or guarantee. If a loan exceeds this limit, a borrower cannot use a conventional loan, and they will have to apply for a Jumbo loan (yes, that's the real name!). Loan limits are set annually based on the market to prevent overborrowing and foreclosures. \n\n## CBSA Number and FIPs Code:\n\n### CBSA... \nstands for Core-Based Statistical Area and is defined as a U.S. geographic area that consists of one or more counties connected by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties.

Here is a resource on [FIPS Metropolitan Area CBSA Codes](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/methodology/2015%20Geography%20Cover.pdf).
